### Description

My starting point on JavaScript. A simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other on the same device.

### Installation

Make sure you have a web browser installed (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

### Run

Either open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser or use a local server to host the files.

Or run it using a server like Live Server in VSCode for better experience.
